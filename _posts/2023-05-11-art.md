## Literature

(1) Romantic literature
The French romantic literature movement came into being under the historical background of the French Revolution, European democratic movement and national liberation movement. It opposed feudalism in politics and classicism in literature and art. It reflected the demand for individual liberation during the rise of the bourgeoisie, and showed a distinct spirit of innovation and political color. The main writers are Hugo, Musset, George Sand and so on.

(2)Realistic literature
French realist writers oppose the academism of classicism and Romanticism, advocate writers observe things objectively and without bias, insist that literary and artistic works must reflect modern life, reflect and describe reality accurately and delicately according to the true nature of life, do not use artistic means to beautify or distort life, and do not avoid the plain or dark scenes in life. The main writers are Stendahl, Merimee, Balzac, Flaubert, Maupassant and so on.

(3)Naturalistic literature
Naturalistic literature is actually an extreme form of realistic literature and a one-sided development of realistic creation principles. It pursues simple facts, opposes any generalization, extraction and synthesis of life, regards human beings as natural persons only subject to biology and pathology, and does not recognize that human beings are also social people. Naturalist writers mainly include the Goncourt brothers, Zola and Tudor.

(4)Paris Commune Literature
Paris Commune literature is an important part of French realism literature in the 19th century. It takes its unique historical events as its basic subject matter and extensively involves the social reality of France during the Paris Commune Revolution. The representative writers are Baltier, Clement, the novelists Vales, Craddle and so on.

(5)Symbolism literature
The development of symbolism literature has gone through two stages, namely the early symbolism literature and the late symbolism literature. From the mid-19th century to the end of the 19th century, the early symbolist literature was represented by Verlaine, Rimbaud and Mallarme. From the beginning of the 20th century to the 1940s, the late symbolist literature was represented by Valery, Rilke, Yeats and Eliot. Symbolist literature originated in France in the second half of the 19th century. It is a counterreaction to positivist philosophy represented by Comte and naturalistic literature represented by Zola. The forerunner of symbolist literature is Baudelaire, but its influence can be traced back to Edgar Allan POE in the United States.

## Drama

(1)Medieval drama
France was a Catholic country with Latin as its official language and Romance as its folk language in the Middle Ages, and drama and literature began to appear in the 9th century. There are mainly two forms of drama, religious drama and secular drama.

(2)Renaissance drama
In the 15th and 16th centuries, religious wars kept cropping up in France, and religious drama was declining. On November 7, 1548, the Council of Paris ordered the cessation of mystery plays, which dealt a fatal blow to religious drama. This is a sign of the Renaissance's success in the field of drama. There were many guilds of citizen drama, and the feudal aristocracy gradually separated from the citizen drama performance activities, which resulted in the differentiation between the citizen drama which was dominated by comedy and the noble literati drama.

(3)Classical period drama
The early representative of classical drama is A. Aldi, who wrote nearly 700 tragedies, tragicomedy and pastoral plays, 51 of which have been handed down to the world. He brought tragedy closer to the stage and explored the coherence of the plot in the play. Moliere was the founder of realistic comedy in the classical period. His comedy, love and hate, radical thought, sympathy for the public, with democratic thought, French literature and art in the 18th century was directly promoted by the bourgeois enlightenment trend of thought.

(4)19th century French drama
In the early 19th century, drama from other European countries was introduced into France, which accelerated the formation of romantic drama in France. Romantic drama requires freedom of creation, emphasizes personal feelings, and reflects social reality through historical traditional themes. In 1827, V. Hugo liquidated classicism in the preface to his play Cromwell. Since then, romantic drama has occupied a dominant position in French drama. In 1829, the premieres of Alexandre Dumas's history play Henry III and His Court and Vinnie's The Moor of Venice were triumphs of romantic drama.

(5)20th century French drama
After the Second World War, the theatre of the absurd appeared in France in the 1950s, rejecting the traditional theatrical creation techniques and having distinct characteristics from content to form. Representative writers include S. Beckett, E. Yunescu, A. Adamov, and J. Genet. It is characterized by the use of stage scenes and characters to express the absurdity of existence, rather than through logical language to achieve this purpose. The works of this period reflect the spiritual emptiness of people after the war and the feeling of absurdity and nothingness of capitalist society.
