# France History

The French Revolution, from 1789 to 1799, had a profound impact on French history and Europe as a whole. It transformed France's political and social structure, overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic. It abolished feudal privileges and proclaimed the Declaration of the Rights of Man, among other changes.

France played a crucial role in both World War I and World War II.
After the French Revolution, France underwent a series of reforms in areas such as education, law, administration, and finance. These reforms had a profound impact on France's modernization and democratization process.
